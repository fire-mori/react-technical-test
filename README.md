# Front-end Developer Technical Test
This a simple product details section of a clothing retail site.

## Things not completed

1.  Cart button should change colour. It can be done by setting borders on left
top and right on the button and by overlapping the pop up by cart button (by
increasing button height).
1.  There should only be one row of the same size product, product quantity in
minicart increases as the same size product is added multiple times.
1.  Projects should be cleaned. There are a lot of code left from the app
generator, like extra actions, components and other stuff.
1.  Project is not actually pixel perfect, requires more time to adjust sizes
and fonts.
1.  Several uses of 'any'.
1.  Ugly alert error message.
